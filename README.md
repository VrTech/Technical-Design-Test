# Technical-Design-Test

**Demo** (WIP) \
[WebGL](https://vrtech.github.io/TechnicalDesignTest/) 

**Ideas**\
The design is focusing on the fluid of the transition between 2D and 3D user graphical interfaces.\
With a clean, simple, and intuitive design, user experience is enhanced without losing the flow of navigation.

**Designed Features**

- Hover Group information\
This shows a compact info card with the group name and members of this world.\
By displaying a small information of this world, it helps user to navigate to the world faster.

- Enter/Exit\
Without changing to another scene, player quickly explore around.

- Tooltip for member's name \
As we recognize images faster than text, the player can easily find familiar faces or avatars.\
At the same time, player can check the name by hovering the mouse at the images as well.
